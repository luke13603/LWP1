    <p>My name is Luke, I am 14 years old and go to Lakeville South High School. My hobbies are watching the weather, playing soccer, doing FTC, as well as various other things. I was on an FLL team called Special Ops Lego Team for 2 years and I have currently been on team 13603 Hacker Cats for 3 years now. On the team, I focus more on the java programming aspect of FTC. I also will get involved in the CADing and robot building process. </p>

    <p>Hi, I’m Cian and I am going to be doing some of the programming, and learning how to CAD which I learned is kind of enjoyable. I Like to play Pokémon, Among Us, and Minecraft. I like to program which. has gotten harder for me but still fun. Planning to make a rhythm game someday not expecting to make a ton of money or anything but just wanna make a fun game.</p>

    <p>My name is Ely, I’m 14 years old and go to Lakeville South High School. I did FLL for 3 years on the team “Marion Mindstorm Minions.” I was on the team last year with Luke, and robotics is without a doubt my favorite thing to do. I love the mechanical side of things and do a lot of the actual building. I’m also the team’s 3D printing and CAD expert because I got my own printer last year.</p>

    <p>Currently we are a 3rd year team consisting of all freshman students at Lakeville South High School. Team 13603 Hackercats was created 3 years ago with a completley different team composition. However, most of the team left for various reasons leaving only two members which included Ely and Luke.
      Although the team quickly gained multiple members due to various things allowing Team 13603, The Hackercats to compete in the 2019-2020 FTC season. Throughout our teams first and second season, we were mentor by veteran team Qbitz who was also based out of Lakville South High School.
